# Insurance Claims Management System
A comprehensive solution for managing insurance policyholders and claims, with integrated risk analysis capabilities.

## üìã Overview

This project provides a complete insurance claims management platform that enables insurance companies to:

- Manage policyholders and their information
- Process and track insurance claims
- Perform risk analysis on claims data
- Visualize claims trends and statistics

The system consists of a FastAPI backend API and a Streamlit web application frontend.

# üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

1. **Backend API (`api.py`)**: FastAPI-powered REST API that handles data processing, database operations, and business logic
2. **Frontend UI (`app.py`)**: Streamlit web application that provides an intuitive user interface for interacting with the system

## ‚ú® Features

# Backend Features

- RESTful API built with FastAPI (version 1.2.1)
- Oracle database integration for data persistence
- Comprehensive data models for policyholders and claims
- Authentication and authorization
- Risk analysis algorithms
- Error handling and validation

# Frontend Features

- Modern, responsive UI built with Streamlit
- Custom styling with CSS for enhanced user experience
- Interactive dashboards with real-time data visualization
- Form-based interfaces for data entry and management
- Date-based filtering and reporting

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Backend:
- FastAPI framework
- Oracle database (via oracledb)
- Pydantic for data validation
- Python 3.8+

### Frontend:
- Streamlit
- Custom CSS
- Font Awesome icons
- Chart visualization libraries

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Oracle Database (local or remote instance)
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-claims-system.git
cd insurance-claims-system
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure the Oracle database connection in `api.py`:
```python
DB_USER = "your_username"
DB_PASSWORD = "your_password"
DB_DSN = "your_host:your_port/your_service"
```

### Usage

#### Running the Backend API
1. Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

#### Running the Frontend Application
1. Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
2. Access the web interface at http://localhost:8501
